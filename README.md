# Digital_stream

This program simulates the "digital stream" visualization from the science fiction movie "The Matrix". Random chains of binary "rain" rise from the bottom of the screen, creating a beautiful visualization reminiscent of a scene from the hacker world. However, because the text moves downward along with screen scrolling, creating downward falling streams without using modules like "bext" is not possible.

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Observe as the binary "rain" cascades from the bottom of the screen, creating an enchanting digital stream.
3. Embrace the ambiance of the hacker world as the visualization captivates your imagination.

## Features

- Experience the iconic "digital stream" visualization from "The Matrix."
- Marvel at the allure of binary chains creating a dynamic and captivating scene.
- Immerse yourself in a captivating portrayal reminiscent of the hacker realm.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python digital_stream.py`.
4. Witness the mesmerizing "digital stream" visualization as it unfolds.
